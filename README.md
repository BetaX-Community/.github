# BetaX Community

BetaX Community is a platform for people from urban areas to
collaboratively enhance commute data to foster an environment for safe
and optimal travel for everyone.

The project started in Antananarivo Madagascar, but we aim to extend
to other urban areas of the region (Indian Ocean, East Africa).

## History

It started with a College project that Marius Rabenarivo (@puchka) and
a bunch of his friends started while they were studying at ESPA (Ecole
Supérieure Polytechnique d'Antananarivo).  The aim was to help people
find bus lines in the urban area of Antananarivo.  Thereafter, people
from the IMV (Institut des Métiers de la Ville) approached them to
collaborate by the mean of providing mapping data and other data
related to bus lines and bus stops.  It turned out that those data were
not exploitable as is and needed more enhancement and cleaning.

BetaX Community started with the idea to provide a tool-chain for
people to contribute to this enhancement and cleaning of mapping data.
It started as a repository in Marius's GitHub
(https://github.com/puchka/BetaX-Community) where he joined effort
with Tsiry Sandratraina (@tsirysndr) to create initial tooling for the
matter.

## Vision

This initiative named BetaX Community is a continuation of that
effort in a more community focused way.  We are willing to build a
community of people who are collaborating to make it easier to build
application related to transportation in urban areas of 3rd World
Countries which we believe are undeserved technologically speaking.
